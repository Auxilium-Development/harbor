# Harbor

Harbor is an OS X-style dock, resdesigned for touch screens.

Compile with [theos](https://github.com/dhowett/theos).

Note: Harbor is written in a custom subset of Logos, which adds the `%property` syntax. This is my own personal fork. To compile Harbor, you'll need to rewrite `%property` into calls to the Objective-C associated object methods.
